\ \\
\begin{list0}
\item Highest resolution global forecast -- 16km
\item SISL -- Semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian -- for efficiency
\begin{list1}
    \item Semi-implicit, spectral solution of Helmholz equation -- for accuracy. Not conservative.
    \item Semi-Lagrangian advection -- for accurate, non-conservative advection with long time steps
\end{list1}
\item Hydrostatic -- historical choice
\item Reduced grid towards the poles
\begin{list1}
    \item Removes need for filtering towards the poles
    \item Can be accurate with high order accuracy or spectral differencing
\end{list1}
\item Global medium range weather and seasonal forecasts.
\begin{list1}
    \item No local area model so no issues with boundary conditions of spectral model
    \item No climate forecasts so long term problems without conservation not a problem
\end{list1}
\item Changed from Lorenz vertical staggering to no vertical staggering with cubic spline interpolation
\end{list0}
