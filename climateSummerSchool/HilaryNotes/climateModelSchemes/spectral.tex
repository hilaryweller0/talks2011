\item As high order accuracy as is possible on any particular grid\\
$\rightarrow$ best accuracy for the computational effort FOR SMOOTH solutions\\
$\rightarrow$ particularly accurate for low resolution

\item Not conservative

\item Requires a periodic domain $\therefore$ not ideal for limited area models

\item Suffers from spectral ringing
\begin{list1}
    \item oscillations either side of discontinuities due to representation of all fields as sums of waves
\end{list1}
\item Parallelisability limited due to global communications of decomposing solution into waves.\\
ECMWF can scale to $\sim$10,000 processors

Express the state, $\phi$, of the atmosphere as a sum of $N$ waves of different waves lengths. 1D Example:

\[
\phi(x,t) = \sum_{k=0}^{N} a_k \sin kx + i~b_k \cos kx = \sum_{k=0}^N A_k e^{ikx}
\]

where $x\in[0, 2\pi]$ and $a_k$, $b_k$ or complex valued $A_k$ are the Fourier coefficients.

Fourier coefficients found using an fft -- fast Fourier transform

$N$ is the spectral resolution or spectral truncation

Remember use for Fourier filtering:\\
