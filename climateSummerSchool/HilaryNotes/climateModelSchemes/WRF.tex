\ \\
\begin{list0}

\item WRF is a mesoscale, local area model (LAM), NOT a global climate model\\
$\therefore$ no poles in the grid, no polar filtering needed, less need for semi-Lagrangian

\item Non-hydrostatic or hydrostatic

\item Arakawa C-grid

\item Lorenz vertical staggering

\item Terrain following vertical coordinate hybrid with hydrostatic pressure

\item Split explicit -- accousitc time step $\frac{1}{4}$ of advection time step

\item Implicit in the vertical to avoid restriction based on vertically propagating sound waves

%\item Divergence damping needed to control grid scale oscillations -- reduces accuracy

\item One way and two way nests to achieve high resolution in part of a large domain
\begin{list1}
    \item Much easier with split-explicit model than with semi-implicit model
\end{list1}

\item VERY good parallelisability reported. But this is for LAM, not the global version.\\Good scaling due to:
\begin{list1}
    \item Split-explicit rather than semi-implicit
    \item No pole problem to deal with which limits scalability
    \item Eulerian rather than semi-Lagrangian
    \item Finite difference rather than spectral
\end{list1}

\item One-way and two-way nesting $\rightarrow$ errors $\therefore$

\end{list0}
