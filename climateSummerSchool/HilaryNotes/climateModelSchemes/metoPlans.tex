\begin{list0}
\item SLICE --Semi-Lagrangian Inherently Conserving and Efficient.
\item Conservative interpolating (mapping) onto departure volumes rather than departure points.
\item Efficient CASCADE conservative interpolation relies on structured grid since each direction is done sequentially.
\end{list0}

\heading{Gung-ho project}

\begin{list0}
\item Joint with 10 academics and STFC
\item Design and build a new, more scalable dynamical core
\item Consider alternative grid structures
