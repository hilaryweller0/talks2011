\large
\begin{list0}

\item Voronoi grids best
    \begin{list1}
    \item Best accuracy for cost
    \item Allows gradual refinement
    \end{list1}

\item Local refinement can degrade accuracy. This is despite:
    \begin{list1}
    \item Global second order accuracy (quadratic differencing)
    \item Staggering of pressure and velocity (Thuburn, Ringler, Skamarock et al)
    \item Gradual refinement
    \item Static refinement
    \item Since balanced flow is transported into a region where it is no longer balanced
    \item Fine scale waves can become trapped in fine resolution region
    \item Upwinded interpolation needed to remove grid scale waves
    \end{list1}

\item Thuburn, Ringler, Skamarock and Klemp staggering for arbitrary meshes beneficial over co-located algorithms
    \begin{list1}
    \item Conservation of energy
    \item Much cheaper
    \end{list1}
