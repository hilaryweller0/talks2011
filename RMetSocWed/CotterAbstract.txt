Physical/non-physical wave propagation on triangular grids
Colin Cotter

Numerical weather prediction and ocean modelling both take place on coarse grids and on long time intervals, and hence predictive skill poses stronger requirements on numerical discretisation methods than the standard convergence of numerical solutions on finite time intervals. Three such requirements can be discussed with reference to the linearised wave equations, namely energy conservation, stationarity of geostrophic modes on the f-plane, and convergence of eigenvalues/eigenspaces. The latter requirement means that there are no spurious non-physical waves which can rapidly pollute the solution and couple with physical modes through the nonlinear terms. Fortunately, such a numerical discretisation exists, namely the Arakawa C-grid on quadrilaterals/hexahedra which is used in many NWP models and ocean models. However, quads/hexes make it difficult to tile the sphere with uniform resolution: the latitude-longitude grid requires filtering at the poles which restricts parallel scalability. Quads/hexes also make it difficult to perform adaptivity, to resolve coastlines and bathymetry. In this talk I will discuss the search for numerical discretisation methods on triangles and tetrahedra which satisfy these three requirements using finite element methods. In particular I will discuss how these requirements can be satisfied provided that the discretisation methods have a suitable representation of the Helmholtz decomposition of velocity fields into rotational and divergent components. I will briefly introduce a recently discovered numerical scheme on triangles, inspired by the Arakawa C-grid in quadrilaterals, that I claim satisfies all three requirements.
