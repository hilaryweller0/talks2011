\item {\color{purple} IPCC Fourth Assessment report -- Robust}

    \begin{list1}
    \item ``Warming of the climate system is unequivocal"
    \item ``Most of the global average warming over the past 50 years is very likely due to anthropogenic GHG increases"
    \item ``Continued GHG emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century that would very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century."
    \end{list1}

\item {\color{purple} IPCC Fourth Assessment report -- Uncertain}

    \begin{list1}
    \item predictions of ``drought, tropical cyclones, extreme temperatures and the frequency and intensity of precipitation"

    \item ``temperature changes to natural or human causes at smaller
than continental scales"
    \item ``cloud feedbacks, oceanic heat uptake and carbon cycle feedbacks"
