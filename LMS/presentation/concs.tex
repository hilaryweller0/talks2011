\begin{slide}{Conclusions}

\begin{list0}

\item Climate models are accurate enough to know that human activity is warming the climate

\item So accurate enough to inform policy aimed at reducing emmsions

\item Climate models are not accurate enough to predict regional climate

\item Mathematicians and scientists needed to create the next generation of climate models that can make these predictions
