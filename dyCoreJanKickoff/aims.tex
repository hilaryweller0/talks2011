\begin{itemize}

\item Compare parallel efficiency and accuracy of semi-implicit versus horizontally explicit time stepping

\item Compare parallel efficiency and accuracy of various grids of the sphere

\item Assemble AtmosFOAM -- a non-hydrostatic, dry dynamical core of the global atmosphere to run on 10K cores on HECToR

\item Create new test cases for simplefied model of the atmosphere to mimic some of the effects of sub-grid scale parametrisations in exciting grid-scale oscillations

\end{itemize}
