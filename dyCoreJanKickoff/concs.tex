\item Comparisons will assess:
    \begin{list1}
    \item cost (caveats)
    \item accuracy
    \item scalability (caveats)
    \end{list1}

\item Comparisons of:
    \begin{list1}
    \item semi-implicit with horizontally explicit time stepping
    \item Different grid structures, eg lat-lon, cubed sphere and hexagonal icosahedral
    \item Thuburn staggered scheme with co-located
    \end{list1}

\item AtmosFOAM -- a freely available, open source dynamical core which runs in parallel on HECToR on a variety of grid structures.

\item New test cases which expose spurious computational modes before a 3D dynamical core with parametrisations is developed
