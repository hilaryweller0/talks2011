\begin{slide}{Why use OpenFOAM}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{list0}

\item Open source, GPL

\item Portable -- was ported to HECToR without help from the developers (OpenCFD Limited)

\item Uses any MPI

\item Includes parallel implementations of a variety of linear equations solvers

\end{list0}

{\centering\bf\Large
AtmosFOAM
}

\begin{list0}

\item Currently shallow water model on the sphere written using OpenFOAM \\
-- $\sim$100 lines of code

\item Can solve equations on any grid of the sphere

\item Semi-implicit and explicit implementations

\item Co-located and Thuburn C-grid implementations

\item More OpenFOAM functionality will be used to extend AtmosFOAM to be a 3D non-hydrostatic model which runs in parallel

\item {\color{purple}\it But} AtmosFOAM does not exploit efficiency gains from using a structured grid

\end{list0}
