\begin{slide}{Explicit Time Stepping Schemes}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
\item If we have to use an explicit scheme, what scheme should we use?

\item Fully explicit, split explicit or HEVI (horizontally explicit, vertically implicit)

\item Runge-Kutte, Adams-Bashforth, ``forward in time'' schemes

\item Splitting and conservation errors of HEVI and split explicit?
\end{itemize}

\heading{Explicit versus Implicit}

\begin{itemize}
\item Relative efficiency, accuracy and scaling of explicit versus implicit

\item Can an explicit and an implicit scheme be chosen with enough similarity between them that the dynamical core can be run with one or the other?

\end{itemize}
