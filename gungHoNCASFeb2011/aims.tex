\begin{itemize}

\item The Current UM does not scale well in parallel due to fundamental design decisions in the dynamical core

\item Exact Local Conservation of mass and all tracers

This will be achieved in EndGame (conservative semi-Lagrangian using SLICE)

\end{itemize}

\heading{Why doesn't the current UM Scale?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Current dynamical core (New Dynamics) and next dynamical core (End Game) use:

\begin{itemize}
\item Lat-lon grid with polar filtering -- polar filters communicate across many processors
\item Semi-Lagrangian -- near the poles, the departure point may be on a distant processor
\item Semi-implicit time stepping -- requires global communication
\end{itemize}

\item EndGame on Yin-Yang grid is under development but ...

\item What algorithms are needed for a more scalable dynamical core with similar accuracy?

\end{itemize}
