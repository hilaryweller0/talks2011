%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}

\item Non-hydrostatic, deep atmosphere

\item Exact local conservation of mass and all tracers

\item Scalable to a million cores? GPUs?

\item Fast turnaround times

\item Accuracy close to current dynamical core

\item Second order accuracy in space and time

\item Free from spurious computational modes (eg checkerboard pattern in Arakawa A and B grids). Therefore must use staggered grid

\item Quasi-uniform resolution. Therefore not lat-lon

\item Twice as many velocity degrees of freedom (in horizontal) than pressure to avoid spurious Rossby or gravity modes. Therefore grid cells must be quadrilaterals?

\end{itemize}
