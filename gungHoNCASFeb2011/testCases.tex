\begin{itemize}

\item We need test cases that expose deficiencies in numerical schemes without the effort of creating 3D models with parametrisations

\item Test cases with grid scale forcing of the shallow water equations

\item We need test cases that indicate if any grid imprinting is important

\item Forced-dissipative extensions to the shallow water equations

\end{itemize}
