\begin{list0}

\item UK models are already (probably) best in the world
\item But regional predictions of climate change are unreliable
\item So climate models need higher resolution
\item This needs faster computers

\begin{list0}
\item Computers are no longer getting faster, just bigger\\
    $\therefore$ more calculations per second
    \begin{list1}
    \item Biggest, k-computer in Japan, half a million processors
    \end{list1}
\item Divide the atmosphere and ocean into small regions for each of the processors
\item However the weather in one location is linked with the weather elsewhere\\
    $\therefore$ lots of communication between processors.
\item The current Met Office model needs too much communication\\
    $\therefore$ only cannot make good use of more than a few 1000 processors
\item How can we design a model that needs less communication?
