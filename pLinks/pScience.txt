The UK Met Office weather and climate forecasting models have proved some of the most accurate in the world. However, supercomputers are becoming larger with less power per processing core and the Met Office models are not performing well on these new computers while other forecasting centres are forging ahead. Forecast speed is often limited by the speed at which different processors on a computer can communicate and so if a model relies on lots of communication it will grind to a halt. The Met Office model divides the planet into latitude-longitude grid boxes which get very narrow near the poles which leads to an excessive amount of communication. In order for the Met Office to remain competitive, they must move away from a latitude-longitude grid to something more like a football, made of hexagons and pentagons. The Gung-Ho project, joint between Natural Environment Research Council funded academics, the Met Office and the Science and Technology Facilities Centre, is carefully scoping the design for a new forecast model which will ensure that the UK remain at the forefront of weather and climate forecasting. This careful design phase is envied world-wide. Conversely, forecasting centres sometimes invest heavily in an untested, flawed strategy as they do not have the time or resources for such careful design.
